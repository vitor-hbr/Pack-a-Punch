# Throwers

A simple VR project about throwing/punching balls into boxes and seeing them explode (kinda) ðŸ™‚

You can grab balls using the grip button, and throw them! You can also freeze balls by using the trigger button while holding them!

To interact with the menu use the joystick to make the interaction ray appear.

Currently the options are not being applied, will implement that soon!
